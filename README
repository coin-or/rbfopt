#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Installation requirements
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package requires the following software:

Python 2.7.* (latest 2.7.* release recommended)
NumPy version >= 1.12.0
SciPy version >= 0.13.3
Pyomo version 4.3.11388

The software has been tested with the versions indicated above. It may
work with earlier version and should work with subsequent version, if
they are backward compatible.

Note that Python 3.* is not compatible with Python 2.7. While our
library is Python 3 compliant and consistently uses "from __future__
import [...]", the code has not been tested on Python 3 yet. We
recommend using Python 2.7. If for some reason you require Python 3,
it should be very easy to port the code.

The easiest way to install all the dependencies is via the Python
module manager pip, using the command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

The file requirements.txt contains the list of required modules and
their latest version that has been tried and found to work
correctly. If your want to install them one at a time, you can try:

pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install pyomo

To build the documentation, you also need numpydoc:

pip install numpydoc

On Windows systems, we recommend WinPython, available at
http://winpython.sourceforge.net/ , which comes with NumPy, SciPy and
pip already installed. After installing WinPython, it is typically
necessary to update the PATH environment variable. The above command
using pip to install missing libraries has been successfully tested on
a fresh WinPython installation.

RBFOpt requires the solution of convex and nonconvex nonlinear
programs (NLPs), as well as nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programs
(MINLPs) if some of the decision variables (design parameters) are
constrained to be integer. Solution of these subproblems is performed
through Pyomo, which supports any solver with an AMPL interface (.nl
file format). In our tests we employed BonMin and Ipopt, that are
open-source and available through the COIN-OR repository. The end-user
is responsible for checking that they have the right to use whatever
solver they employs.

To obtain pre-compiled binaries for BonMin and Ipopt for several
platforms, we suggest having a look at:
http://ampl.com/products/solvers/open-source/
and
http://ampl.com/dl/open/
(for static binaries).

In case any of the packages indicated above is missing, some features
may be disabled, not function properly, or the software may not run at
all.

This package can take advantage of supported linear programming
solvers to increase the speed of the automatic model selection
procedure. Supported solvers:

IBM-ILOG Cplex via its Python API
COIN-OR Clp via CyLP (see https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP).

The two packages above are optional.


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Installation instructions and getting started
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Install the required packages NumPy, SciPy, Pyomo, as
   indicated above. If you use pip, you can verify that they are
   present with the commands:

   pip show numpy
   pip show scipy
   pip show pyomo

2) Edit rbfopt_config.py to point to the correct location for the NLP
   and MINLP solvers, using the MINLP_SOLVER_PATH and NLP_SOLVER PATH 
   variables.

3) Enjoy!

4) You can test the installation by running:
   python2.7 tests/rbfopt_test_interface.py branin
   
   See:
   python2.7 tests/rbfopt_test_interface.py --help
   for more details on command-line options for the testing utility.

   Many more test functions, with different characteristics, are
   implemented in the file test_functions.py. They can all be used for
   testing.

5) Unit tests for the library can be executed by running:

   python2.7 -m unittest discover -s tests/

   from the current (main) directory. This may take some time. If some
   of the tests fail, the library may or may not work correctly. Some
   of the test failures are relatively harmless. You are advised to
   contact the mailing list (see below) if you are unsure about some
   test failure.

6) To run the library on a user-defined black-box function, have a
   look at the example in src/rbfopt_black_box_example.py. You can
   implement a similar class (derived from rbfopt_black_box.BlackBox),
   say in a file called my_black_box.py, and the alorithm can be
   executed on it by running:

   python2.7 src/rbfopt_cl_interface.py -m my_black_box.py

   See:
   python2.7 src/rbfopt_cl_interface.py --help
   for more details on command-line options.

   (If no module is specified with the -m option, the algorithm will
   be applied to rbfopt_black_box_example.py.)

7) To take advantage of faster model selection procedures, you must
   have either IBM-ILOG Cplex or COIN-OR Clp available on your
   machine. By default, the model selection procedure uses Numpy and
   it can be slow on large problems. Using Cplex (via its Python
   library) or Clp (via CyLP) can increase its speed dramatically. If
   one of these packages is installed and available via the
   corresponding "import" Python command (i.e. "import cplex" and
   "import cylp.cy"), you can select the corresponding value for the
   option model_selection_solver.


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Parallel optimization
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

RBFOpt supports asynchronous parallel optimization using Python's
multiprocessing library. This mode is enabled whenever the parameter
num_cpus is set to a value greater than 1. Black-box function
evaluations as well as some of the heaviest computatations carried out
by the algorithm will then be executed in parallel. Since the parallel
computations are asynchronous, determinism cannot be guaranteed: in
other words, if you execute the parallel optimizer twice in a row, you
may (and often will) get different results, even if you provide the
same random seed. This is because the order in which the computations
will be completed may change, and this may impact the course of the
algorithm.

The default parameters of the algorithm are optimized for the serial
optimization mode. Recommended parameters for the parallel
optimization will be detailed in the future. For now, feel free to ask
on the mailing list.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Documentation
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The documentation for the code can be built using Sphinx with the
numpydoc extension. numpydoc can be installed with pip (if you
followed our instructions above, it should already be installed):

pip install numpydoc

After that, the directory doc/ contains a Makefile (on Windows, use
make.bat) and the Sphinx configuration file conf.py.

You can build the HTML documentation (recommended) with:

make html

The output will be located in _build/html/ and the index can be found
in _build/html/index.html .

A PDF version of the documentation (much less readable than the HTML
version) can be built using the command:

make latexpdf

An online version of the documentation for the latest master branch of
the code, and for the latest stable release, are available on
ReadTheDocs at the following URLs:

http://rbfopt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
http://rbfopt.readthedocs.org/en/stable/
