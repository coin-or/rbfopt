"""Configuration file for RBFOpt.

This modules contains the system-wide options for RBFOpt. The values
below can be changed at runtime, but it makes more sense to use this
as a static configuration file.

Attributes
----------

MINLP_SOLVER_NAME : str
    Name of the MINLP solver.

MINLP_SOLVER_PATH : str 
    MINLP solver executable, including path if the executable is not
    in your path. Use '/' to delimit directories, even on Windows, to
    avoid issues with escaping backward slashes.

MINLP_SOLVER_OPTIONS : List[(str, Any)]
    Options passed on to the MINLP solver, in the form ('option_name',
    value)

MINLP_SOLVER_RAND_SEED_OPTION : str or None
    Option name to initialize MINLP solver's random seed. Set to None
    if option is not supported.

MINLP_SOLVER_MAX_SEED : int
    Maximum integer that can be used to seed the MINLP solver's random
    seed.

NLP_SOLVER_NAME : str
    Name of the NLP solver.

NLP_SOLVER_PATH : str 
    NLP solver executable, including path if the executable is not
    in your path. Use '/' to delimit directories, even on Windows, to
    avoid issues with escaping backward slashes.

NLP_SOLVER_OPTIONS : List[(str, Any)]
    Options passed on to the NLP solver, in the form ('option_name',
    value)

NLP_SOLVER_RAND_SEED_OPTION : str or None
    Option name to initialize NLP solver's random seed. Set to None
    if option is not supported.

NLP_SOLVER_MAX_SEED : int
    Maximum integer that can be used to seed the NLP solver's random
    seed.

GAMMA : float
    Parameter gamma for some of the radial basis functions. This is
    essentially a scaling parameter and it is very hard to control at
    runtime, so we treat it as a constant.

LOCAL_SEARCH_THRESHOLD : float
    Threshold used to determines what is a local search. If the
    scaling factor used in the computation of f_n^* is less than this
    value, it is assumed that the search is a local search.

DISTANCE_SHIFT : float
    Shift of the argument of the square root operator in the
    computation of distances, in order to prevent computing the
    derivative of sqrt(0) if we are evaluating a point that coincides
    with one of the nodes. Note that this shift is usually unnecessary
    in the continuous setting, but for all-integer problems, it is
    common that in Branch-and-Bound we end up exactly on one of the
    nodes. This should be a very small value, so that it is
    essentially ignored unless the argument of the square root is
    zero.

MAX_RANDOM_INIT : int
    Maximum number of trials for the random initialization strategies,
    in case they generate a linearly dependent set of samples. After
    this number of trials, the initialization algorithm will bail out.
